/*3.4.1 Ternary operator
Write a program that loops indefinitely. In each iteration of the loop, read in an integer N
(declared as an int) that is inputted by a user, output N
5 if N is nonnegative and divisible by
5, and -1 otherwise. Use the ternary operator (?:) to accomplish this. (Hint: the modulus
operator may be useful.)
--------------------------------------------------------
ternary operators are AWESOME!  Took me a second, been wanting something like this. */

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{

	while(1)
	  {
	  int N;
	  cout << "Enter a number to see what it divided by 5 is\n";
	  cin >> N;
	  //ternary!!!!! cool.
	  cout << ((N >= 0 & N % 5 == 0 ? N/5 : -1)) << endl;
	  }

system("pause");
