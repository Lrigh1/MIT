/*2.2 Hello World II
Write a program that outputs “Hello, World!” n times (where n is a nonnegative integer
that the user will input) with:
• a for loop.
• a while loop.
• a do...while loop.
---------------------------
Hello World with loops.  Had to use multiple int variable to run them all, unlike python these loops changed the global i.
experementing with this format, looks decent with colors in environment*/


#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
const char* hello = "Hello, World";
	//define the counter and get input for a number of loops
	int i = 0;
	int k =0;
	int l =0;
	int x;
	cin >> x;

	//for loop
	//counter already defined
	for(; i < x ; i++)
	{
	cout << hello << endl;
	}
	
	//while loop
	while (k < x)
	{
	cout << hello << endl;
	k = k++;
	}

	//do- while loop
	do
	{
	cout << hello << endl;
	l = l++;
	}
	while (l < x);



system("pause");
}
