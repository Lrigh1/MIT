/*4.5 Rewriting Factorial II
Since we know that only a small number of inputs produce valid outputs, we can alternatively
hardcode the factorials of these inputs. Rewrite the program from the previous part
(“Rewriting Factorial”) using a switch statement to demonstrate for inputs up to 10 how
you would do this. (Of course, the code for inputs above 10 would basically be the same,
but you do not need to go through the work of finding all those large factorials.)

Needed a little help on this one, but understood near the end of finishing it up!*/
